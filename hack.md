Recently, I experienced a hack that affected my Geometry Dash account. Somehow, someone gained access to my data, and as a result, all of my progress got corrupted. Levels I had completed, my custom creations, and even my saved settings were either missing or completely broken. It’s really frustrating because I spent a lot of time earning achievements and building levels, but now most of it is gone due to the data corruption caused by the hack. I’m currently trying to recover what I can, but it’s been a tough setback.
