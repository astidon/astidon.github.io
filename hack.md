Recently, I experienced a hack that affected my Geometry Dash account. Somehow, someone gained access to my data, and as a result, all of my progress got corrupted. Levels I had completed, my custom creations, and even my saved settings were either missing or completely broken. It’s really frustrating because I spent a lot of time earning achievements and building levels, but now most of it is gone due to the data corruption caused by the hack. On the bright side, BingBong is now helping rate levels, and on some days, I even rate levels myself! I’m currently trying to recover what I can, and despite the setback, I’m still active in the community and doing my best to stay positive.
